#
# This file (mountiso-1.0.1.SHA256.asc) is used to authenticate download of
# mountiso version 1.0.1
# 
# Homepage: http://igurublog.wordpress.com/downloads/script-mountiso/
# 
# 
# Why Authenticate?
# 
#   Verifying the authenticity of downloaded files prior to installation is
#   important to ensure that your download is not corrupt and that no one has
#   tampered with the server holding the files.
#
#
# 1) If you don't already have IgnorantGuru's CURRENT key on your keyring:
#
#   gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 0x7977070A723C6CCB696C0B0227A5AC5A01937621
#     (if you receive an error, try again)
#     
#   Also visually verify that the given fingerprint matches the one shown here:
#     http://igurublog.wordpress.com/contact-ignorantguru/
#
#
# 2) Download one or more files (the first is required):
#
#   wget https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/mountiso/raw/master/packages/1.0.1/mountiso-1.0.1.SHA256.asc
#   wget https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/mountiso/raw/master/packages/1.0.1/mountiso_1.0.1-1_all.deb
#   wget https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/mountiso/raw/master/packages/1.0.1/mountiso-1.0.1.tar.xz
#
#
# 3) Check signature and files:
#
#   gpg -d mountiso-1.0.1.SHA256.asc | sha256sum --check
#
#   This should report a good signature and an OK for each file present:  
#
#     gpg: Signature made <SIGNATURE DATE> using DSA key ID 01937621    <--
# --> mountiso_1.0.1-1_all.deb: OK
# --> mountiso-1.0.1.tar.xz: OK
# --> gpg: Good signature from IgnorantGuru <EMAIL>
#     gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
#     gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
#     sha256sum: WARNING: x lines are improperly formatted
#
#   If "BAD signature" or the wrong key ID is reported, or if FAILED appears
#   next to any file you plan to use, DO NOT USE the file.  A "key is not
#   certified" warning (shown above) is normal and can be safely ignored if
#   you visually verified the key fingerprint in step 1.
